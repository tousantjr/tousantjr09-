/**
 * A channel logo on its tile.
 *
 * Provider logos are overwhelmingly transparent PNGs, so a tile with a solid fill shows that fill
 * through the artwork as a black square around it. The fill is therefore drawn only when there is no
 * logo to show — while [fallback] is on screen, or after the image fails to load.
 *
 * Transparency alone is not enough, though: most logos are drawn for a light background, so a
 * dark-ink one (A&E, ABC) then disappears into the dark UI. Each logo's own ink is measured once and
 * the few that would be unreadable get a plate behind them, in the opposite luminance to the surface
 * they sit on. The artwork itself is never recoloured, and the tile never changes size, so a plate
 * appearing cannot shift the layout around it.
