/**
 * Put focus back on the control that opened a dialog, and hold the list still while it lands.
 *
 * Restoring focus after a modal closes is two jobs, not one, and doing them in sequence is what made
 * the highlight visibly *travel* across the screen on the way back:
 *
 *  1. **Focus.** The dialog's own window still owns focus for a frame or two after the flag flips, so
 *     a single early request is silently dropped. Hence the retry per frame until one is accepted.
 *  2. **Scroll.** Tearing down a scrim dialog makes Compose re-search focus through the scrollable
 *     that is suddenly exposed again; it lands on the first row, resets the offset and
 *     bringIntoView-animates. The previous fix snapped the offset back **once** and then waited 80 ms
 *     before asking for focus — which works only while the dialog tears down inside that one frame. A
 *     heavier dialog (Glass Effect, About) tore down *after* the snap, so the re-search scrolled the
 *     list anyway and the restore then animated all the way back down: the "focus arriving from
 *     another setting" the user sees. Re-asserting the offset every frame leaves the re-search nothing
 *     to animate.
 *
 * Stops as soon as focus has landed and the offset has been steady for a moment, so it never fights a
 * user who is already pressing a direction key.

 * captured here, when the dialog opens, so no caller has to thread a saved offset of its own.
