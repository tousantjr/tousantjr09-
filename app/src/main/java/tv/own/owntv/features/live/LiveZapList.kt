/**
 * The channel list the player zaps within — CH+/CH−, the D-pad, the in-player channel-list overlay —
 * and the bookkeeping a numeric direct tune needs to stay responsive while that list catches up.
 *
 * Split out of `LiveViewModel`, which was doing four jobs at once. The seam is the same shape as
 * [LiveTimeshift]'s: this class owns **state and sequencing**, the view model owns **queries**. Which
 * list is armed, which channel CH+ lands on, which rebuild is allowed to publish and when the
 * direct-tune anchor expires all live here; every database read and every hide/rename rule arrives as
 * a loader lambda, because those rules are shared with the browse lists and belong with them.
 *
 * The two things that go wrong here are both invisible in a log, which is why they are pinned by
 * tests: a background rebuild publishing over a list the user has since navigated away from, and
 * CH+/CH− going dead in the window after a numeric jump lands outside the current list.
