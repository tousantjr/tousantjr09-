/**
 * Local sync from the television's side — the same feature the phone has, driven with a D-pad.
 *
 * The television is usually the one being connected TO: it shows a PIN and a QR code and the phone's
 * camera reads it. But it can also go the other way, because a sync only one device can start is not
 * much of a sync — so the phone can be found on the network here too, and the PIN typed with the
 * remote.
 *
 * Everything below is core's ([LocalSyncManager]); this only sequences the screen.
