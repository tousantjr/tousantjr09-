/**
 * What to do when a catch-up programme reaches its end and auto-play is on.
 *
 * A finished archive programme used to leave a black screen, which is the whole reason this exists.
 * The decision looks obvious — "play the next one" — but it has three outcomes, and picking the wrong
 * one is worse than doing nothing:
 *
 *  - the next programme has already finished airing → its archive is complete, play it;
 *  - the next programme is on the air **right now** → the viewer has caught up with the present, and
 *    its archive covers only the part that has aired, so it would end again within seconds and drop
 *    them back here. Hand over to the live stream instead — that IS the next programme;
 *  - anything else (no guide beyond this point, or a gap before the next entry) → stop, exactly as
 *    the app behaves today.
 *
 * Pure, no Android and no I/O, so the boundaries are unit-testable without a player or a database.
