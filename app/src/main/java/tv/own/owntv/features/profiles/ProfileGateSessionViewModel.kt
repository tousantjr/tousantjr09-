/**
 * Activity-scoped gate/session state for the profile gate and the in-session "Who's watching?"
 * transitions. Owns nothing persisted.
 *
 * **Why a ViewModel and not `rememberSaveable`** (see `docs/internationalization.md`, Phase 0a —
 * "The profile gate: configuration-only retention, never saveable"):
 *
 * The authenticated profile id must survive an Activity recreation caused by a *configuration* change
 * (font scale, dark mode, a script-family language switch — all of which OwnTV now triggers far more
 * often than before i18n), so the user is not dumped back at the PIN gate mid-session. But it must
 * **not** survive system-initiated process death: `rememberSaveable` persists through
 * `onSaveInstanceState`, which is restored after a background kill, and a restored authentication id
 * would put a user straight past the profile/PIN gate when Android revives the task — precisely the
 * case the gate exists to cover.
 *
 * A ViewModel tied to the Activity's `ViewModelStore` has exactly that lifetime: it survives
 * configuration recreations through store retention, and is cleared when the process dies. There is
 * deliberately **no `SavedStateHandle`** and **no saved-state key** for the authentication flag. The
 * neighbouring in-session navigation flags (`addingProfile`, `switchProfileRequested`) share that
 * lifetime because they are transient UI navigation the user expects to survive a rotation but not a
 * kill; they were audited individually rather than batch-converted (see the table in the same
 * section of the plan). The active profile's existence and membership are observed from the Room
 * list and persisted active id in `MainActivity`, never remembered as launch permission.
