/**
 * Auto frame rate (AFR) — switch the DISPLAY to a refresh rate that matches the video, so 24/25/50 fps
 * content stops juddering on a fixed 60Hz output.
 *
 * Two independent mechanisms exist on Android and OwnTV uses both:
 *
 * 1. `Surface.setFrameRate()` (API 30+) — a *hint* attached to the video surface. Cheap and seamless,
 *    but it does nothing at all on Android 10 and below. See [MpvVideoSurface] and ExoPlayer's
 *    `setVideoChangeFrameRateStrategy`.
 * 2. `WindowManager.LayoutParams.preferredDisplayModeId` (API 23+) — an explicit request for one of the
 *    display's advertised modes. This is what actually works on older TV boxes, notably Fire OS 7
 *    (API 28) where mechanism 1 is unavailable. That's the case in the report this was written for
 *    (Fire TV Stick 4K Max, Fire OS 7.7.1.3 — AFR worked in other players, which use this API).
 *
 * This controller implements mechanism 2. It is deliberately **window-level**, not surface-level:
 * `preferredDisplayModeId` is an attribute of the Activity's window, so it cannot live inside
 * [MpvVideoSurface] / `ExoPreviewSurface`. Both engines route through here, which also means VOD/mpv
 * gets working AFR on Fire OS 7 for the first time (previously mechanism 1 only → a silent no-op).
 *
 * Mode selection keeps the CURRENT resolution and only varies the refresh rate — never switch a 4K
 * output down to 1080p just to hit a rate. A mode is a match when its refresh rate is an integer
 * multiple (1x–3x) of the video fps, which makes 24fps prefer 24/48/72Hz and 25fps prefer 50Hz while
 * still accepting 60Hz for 30fps. Among matches a **seamless** switch wins first, then the LOWEST
 * multiple (a true 24Hz beats 72Hz) — see [pickMode].
 *
 * Every actual mode change costs an HDMI re-handshake, and on a live stream that black gap reads as
 * "the picture paused". Two guards keep changes to the ones that earn it: [snapFps] stops a drifting
 * *measured* frame rate from picking a different mode each time it is re-sampled, and a cooldown in
 * [apply] collapses a burst of requests into one switch.
 *
 * Everything is best-effort: no matching mode, a locked-down display, or a manufacturer that ignores
 * the request all degrade to "leave the display alone", never to a crash or a black screen.

     * Android TV's own **Match content frame rate** setting (API 31+), and what OwnTV does with it.
     *
     * **The decision, stated plainly: the system setting wins.** When the OS is set to *Never*, OwnTV
     * does not change the display mode even if its own Auto frame rate is on — [pickMode] returns null,
     * which every caller already treats as "leave the display alone". When the OS is set to *Seamless
     * only*, OwnTV restricts itself to modes the panel can move to without re-handshaking HDMI. Anything
     * else — *Always*, an unknown value, or an Android version that has no such setting — behaves exactly
     * as before.
     *
     * Why that way round rather than letting the app's toggle override the system's:
     *
     *  - The two settings are not peers. The system one is a statement about **this television**: the
     *    user has been through an HDMI handshake they disliked and told the platform to stop. OwnTV's is
     *    a statement about **this app's content**. "Match the frame rate, when the TV allows it" is a
     *    coherent reading of both; "match it even though you were told not to" is not.
     *  - The platform already enforces it on the *other* AFR mechanism. `Surface.setFrameRate()` (see
     *    the class comment, mechanism 1) is silently ignored when the preference is *Never*. Without
     *    this check OwnTV would be doing through `preferredDisplayModeId` precisely what the platform
     *    refuses to do through the supported API — a back door, and one whose black gap the user has
     *    already objected to.
     *  - It costs the user nothing they cannot undo: the OS setting is two screens away in Android TV's
     *    own display settings, and turning it back to *Always* restores OwnTV's full behaviour with no
     *    change needed here.
     *
     * Because the gate lives in [pickMode], the "Auto frame rate would help here" prompt goes quiet too
     * — [betterRefreshRateFor] shares this path, so the app cannot offer a switch it would then refuse
     * to make.
