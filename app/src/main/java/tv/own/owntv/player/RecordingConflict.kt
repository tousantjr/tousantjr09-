/**
 * Is this playback failure one a busy provider produces?

 * Matched on the type rather than on rendered text. Two shapes qualify:
 *
 * - **`Raw` carrying HTTP 458** — the provider saying outright "your account's session is already in
 *   use", which is the code `LiveStreamQuirks.isSessionLimit` already recognises.
 * - **`StreamUnavailable`** — the generic refusal. On its own it means little, which is why this is
 *   only ever consulted *after* the caller has established that something is recording. D4 is
 *   explicit that the app should attribute the failure precisely because it knows the user pressed
 *   record; without a recording running, none of this is reached.
 *
 * Deliberately not `LostConnection` or the decoder failures: those have nothing to do with the
 * provider's stream count, and offering to stop a recording would be a lie about the cause.
