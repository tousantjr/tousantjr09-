/**
 * "REC", over the picture, for as long as anything is being recorded.
 *
 * The status pill carries recordings everywhere else in the app (D13), but the shell hides the pill
 * during fullscreen playback — so this is the only thing standing between a user and an hour of
 * recording they had no idea was happening. It renders nothing at all when nothing is recording.
 *
 * It does not say *what* is recording. The programme title would be a second line over the picture,
 * and the question this badge answers is "is my provider's connection busy right now?", which needs
 * no title. The Recordings screen has the details.
