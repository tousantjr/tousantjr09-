/**
 * The zap list — what CH+/CH− steps through, and the bookkeeping that keeps it working across a
 * numeric tune that lands outside the current list.
 *
 * Two failures live here and neither is visible in a log, which is why they are pinned: a background
 * rebuild publishing over a list the user has already navigated away from, and CH+/CH− going dead in
 * the seconds between a numeric jump and its rebuild.
 *
 * No player, no database, no view model — the loaders are lambdas, so this is the sequencing on its own.
