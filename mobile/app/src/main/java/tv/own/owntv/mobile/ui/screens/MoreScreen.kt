/**
 * The hub behind the More tab: everything that is neither content nor a preference.
 *
 * Nine rows in three groups — where you go, your own data, and the app itself. Backup, Local sync,
 * the error log and About are here rather than in Settings because none of them is a setting: they
 * were in Settings only because Settings was the only door.
 *
 * Downloads and Settings are also rail destinations on a tablet, so they are reachable two ways
 * there and one way on a phone — the same screen either way.
 *
 * There is deliberately no "Add playlist", "Restore backup" or "Sync now" row: all three already
 * live where they belong, and a second door is what this screen exists to remove.

/**
 * The television's "Rebuild Now Trending", on the phone.

 * Trending is read-only on mobile by Plan 4's own rule — the row shows what core last stored, and the
 * refresh is scheduled a few days apart. That timer is the problem when a trending bug is being
 * chased: reproducing it means waiting days, or driving the television. This forces the download for
 * every playlist on the active profile, right now, ignoring the timer.
 *
 * Deliberately unthrottled beyond its own two-second chip, for the reason the television's is:
 * `BuildConfig.DEV_TOOLS` is false in every published APK, so R8 deletes this function and the row
 * that calls it, and a maintainer chasing a bug needs to press it as often as the bug requires.
 *
 * English-only, like the two rows above it and by the same exception — it never reaches a user. The
 * chip is the one exception: core already has that word translated, so it costs nothing to use it.
