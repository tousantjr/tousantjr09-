/**
 * Data saver: refuse to open a stream over the mobile network.
 *
 * Asked once per stream rather than watched, because the answer only matters at the moment something
 * starts — a connection that becomes metered mid-film is not worth cutting off, and a user who walks
 * out of Wi-Fi range would otherwise lose the picture without touching anything.
 *
 * The refusal has to say so itself. Nothing is on screen at that point but the channel the user just
 * tapped, and the player's own failure messages are about a stream that started and went wrong —
 * "no internet" here would be a lie, because the phone has a perfectly good connection.
