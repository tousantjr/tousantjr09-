/**
 * A rounded rectangle whose corners have **continuous curvature**: the curve starts further along the
 * edge and eases into the turn instead of meeting the straight side at a sudden change of radius.
 *
 * It is what makes the Aurora glass read as a moulded pane rather than a rectangle with its corners
 * filed off, and the difference is most visible exactly where this app uses it — large sheets and
 * panels against a photograph. The maths is AndroidX's; a hand-rolled approximation goes visibly
 * wrong at small radii, which is the one place a corner is looked at closely.
