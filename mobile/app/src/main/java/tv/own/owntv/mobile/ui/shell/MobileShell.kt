 *
 * The navigation is the bottom bar on a phone and a rail on anything wider, chosen by width rather
 * than by device type — a phone in landscape and a foldable opened flat are both "wider", and a
 * tablet in split-screen is not. Which destinations appear is core's `NavVisibility` rule, the same
 * one the TV app's sidebar uses, so a channels-only playlist loses Movies and Series in both apps at once.
