/**
 * Local sync, from the phone's side.
 *
 * Two roles, and the user picks which one this device is playing. **Hosting** puts a PIN and a QR
 * code on screen and waits — that is what the television scans or types. **Connecting** goes the
 * other way: the phone finds the television, is paired once, and from then on can send to it,
 * receive from it, or do both.
 *
 * Nothing is ever applied without being shown first. A received file sits in the cache until the
 * user has seen what it would change and said yes, because the one outcome worth engineering
 * against is somebody tapping the wrong direction and losing a household's watch history.
