/**
 * Every route in the app.
 *
 * A destination is a route rather than an expanding block so that the system back gesture is what
 * closes it, and so each keeps its own scroll state.
 *
 * The `when` below is exhaustive over [MobileDestination] and deliberately has no `else`: a
 * destination added without a screen is then a compile error rather than a blank page at runtime.
 * It carried one until Plan 4 finished, along with a `PlaceholderScreen` to fill it; every
 * destination has had a real screen for some time, so both are gone.
