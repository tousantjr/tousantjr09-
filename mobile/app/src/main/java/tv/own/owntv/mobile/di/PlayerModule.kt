/**
 * The libmpv player, bound app-side.
 *
 * `:player-core` deliberately ships no Koin module of its own — it is a plain library, and the app
 * that hosts it decides how many engines it wants and when they are created. The TV app's
 * `playerModule` binds five (full player, live preview, hero preview, session, subtitles); this one
 * binds the two that a mobile app cannot do without, and will grow as the real screens land.
 *
 * Every constructor argument resolves out of core's own `dataModule`, so nothing else has to be
 * declared here. The two engines are built by player-core's shared builders (`ownTVPlayer()`,
 * `livePreviewEngine()`), the same ones the television uses.
