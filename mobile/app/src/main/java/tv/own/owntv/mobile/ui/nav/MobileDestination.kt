 * least one of its sections is in `NavVisibility.visibleSections()`, so a channels-only playlist loses
 * Movies and Series in both apps at once.
 *
 * MORE has no section: it is always reachable — from the avatar on a phone, from the rail on a tablet —
 * because Settings, Profiles and Downloads live behind it and a user must never be able to hide their way
 * out of the app's own settings.
