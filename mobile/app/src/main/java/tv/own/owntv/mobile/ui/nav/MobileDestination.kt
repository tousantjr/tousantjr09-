/**
 * Where the phone can navigate to.
 *
 * [sections] is what ties a destination to core's visibility rule: a destination shows only when at
 * least one of its sections is in `NavVisibility.visibleSections()`. Library is one tab covering two
 * sections, which is why the rule is a set and not a single value — a movies-only playlist still
 * gets a Library tab, a channels-only one does not.
 *
 * MORE has no section: it is always reachable, because Settings, Profiles and Downloads live behind
 * it and a user must never be able to hide their way out of the app's own settings.
