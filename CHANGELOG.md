# OwnTV — Changelog

> Release notes: two parts per version — New features (by name) and Fixes. This file feeds the GitHub release body and the in-app update dialog.
>
> **Rule: bullet points only — no descriptions.** Each line is a short bolded feature/fix title and
> nothing more. The only extra detail ever allowed is a contribution credit for community work.
> Issue numbers that are part of a title are fine; explanatory parentheticals are not. The detail —
> what, why, files and verification — belongs in the commit message, never here.
