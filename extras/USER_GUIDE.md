# OwnTV — User Guide

Everything OwnTV can do, **where to find it**, and the remote shortcuts that make it fast.

Each entry is one line about what it does and one line about where it lives. Nothing here is
required reading — skim the headings and stop where something looks useful.

> **The basics:** **D-pad** moves · **OK** selects · **Back** goes up a level.
> The left column is the navigation panel. **Long-press OK** on almost anything opens its menu —
> that is where favourites, rename, hide, record and catch-up live.

---

## 🚀 Start here

A fresh install walks you through five screens:

```
Language  →  Text size  →  Disclaimer  →  Profile  →  Add a playlist
```

1. **Language** — pick one of 26, or keep **System default**.
2. **Text size** — set UI Zoom and Font size while a sample sentence resizes, so you judge it from
   your sofa. Changeable later in Settings → Look & Feel.
3. **Disclaimer** — OwnTV is a player; you bring the sources.
4. **Profile** — create one, or restore a backup.
5. **Add a playlist** — M3U, Xtream or Stalker. You can also **Skip for now**.

### 📱 Type the playlist on your phone instead
**Where:** Add source → **Remote**
The TV shows a QR code and a 6-digit PIN. Scan it with a phone on the same Wi-Fi, fill the form
there — or upload an `.m3u` file straight from a computer — and press **Send to TV**. You still press
**Start Import** on the TV. *(Idea from community PR #66 by @zarga03.)*

### ⏳ Don't wait for the import
**Where:** the import screen → **Run in background**
Enter the app immediately. A status pill at the bottom shows progress.

## 🧭 Getting around

```
┌──────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────────────────┐
│ Sidebar  │  Categories  │  Channels / posters         │  + preview pane
│ Home     │  Favorites   │                             │

└──────────┴──────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘
      ← Left from a list jumps back to the column on its left
```

**⋯ More** is the last sidebar item: Settings, Favourites, History, Backup, Local sync, Error log and
About. Its right-hand panel *describes* each row before you open it — it never takes focus, so
**Right does nothing there on purpose**.

## 🎛️ Remote shortcuts — the cheat sheet

| Key | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Long-press OK** | any channel, film or show | The options menu — favourite, rename, hide, record, catch-up, move, download |
| **Left** | full-screen live | Channel list for the folder you came from |
| **Left ×2** | full-screen live | All Live TV categories — switch folder without stopping the stream |
| **Right** | full-screen live | The last 30 channels you watched |
| **CH+ / CH−** | full-screen live | Next / previous channel. Wraps around. Always works |
| **Up / Down** | full-screen live, controls hidden | Same as CH+/CH− |
| **0–9** | full-screen live | Type a channel number to tune. OK submits, Back cancels |
| **CH+ / CH−** | any browse list | Page by 10 items. **Long-press** jumps to first/last |
| **Back** | full-screen player | Leaves full screen (there is no exit button) |
| **OK** | full-screen player | Shows / hides the controls |

**Want different keys?** **Settings → Content → Remote Shortcuts** maps spare colour, number, channel
and media keys to 25 actions. D-pad, Back, OK, volume, Home and power stay protected.

## 📥 Playlists & sources

### ➕ Add a playlist
**Where:** Settings → Manage sources → Add source
**Xtream** (server + user + password), **M3U** (URL or a local file), or **Stalker/Ministra**
(portal URL + MAC).

### 🧪 Test connection
**Where:** inside the Add/Edit form, and on each saved playlist row
Says whether the account is active, when it expires, whether it's a trial, and how many connections
are in use. Nothing is imported — it only asks.

### ⚡ Choose what to sync
**Where:** while adding an Xtream or Stalker playlist
Per section: **Now** (import first), **Later** (background), **Off** (never fetched). Stalker
defaults to Live now, Movies/Series later, because Stalker VOD has no bulk endpoint.

### 🔄 Re-sync
**Where:** Settings → Manage sources → the playlist
**Resync now** adds and updates. **Resync and remove missing titles** also drops what the provider
has stopped listing. Neither touches your favourites, history, resume points or manual order.

### 🗂️ Several playlists at once
**Where:** the playlist chip in the top-right
Pick **All playlists** or just one — it applies everywhere at once and survives a restart. A
**DEFAULT** badge in Settings marks your default. When two are active, a small provider label appears
beside categories and items so you always know which is which.

### 📶 Prefer HLS (Xtream only)
**Where:** Add/Edit playlist
Ask the panel for HLS instead of MPEG-TS. Try it if live channels are unstable. **Test HLS support**
just above it checks whether your provider really serves it.

### 📡 Stalker portals
**Where:** Add source → Stalker (MAC)
Portal URL plus MAC. Stricter portals also take Serial Number, Device ID, Device ID2 and Signature
under **Advanced device identification**.
> **"Portal refused the login"?** Check the MAC, and check the TV's **date & time** — Stalker
> validates timestamps and a clock a few minutes out fails the handshake.

---

## 📺 Live TV

### ▶️ Watch a channel
**Where:** Live TV → focus a channel → **OK**
The preview pane plays it first; OK goes full screen with no reload.

### ⭐ Favourite, rename, hide
**Where:** long-press **OK** on a channel
The same menu also holds **Match EPG**, **Catch-up**, **Record**, **Move**, **Add to Multiview** and
**Play in external player**. A Favorites folder sits at the top of the category column.

### 🏷️ What the row tells you
Under each channel name: the programme on now, its real category, a genre colour dot, catch-up
availability and guide coverage.

### 🔧 Compatibility mode (swap the player engine)
**Where:** full-screen player → the **⇄ MPV/EXO** pill
If a channel stutters, shows artifacts or won't open, one press flips it to the other engine and
**remembers that channel's choice**. The pill always shows the engine actually playing.

### 🏛️ Which engine channels start on
**Where:** Settings → Video player → **Live TV player**
**ExoPlayer, then mpv** (default) · **mpv, then ExoPlayer** · **ExoPlayer only** · **mpv only**. The
"only" choices switch off the automatic handover, which costs a few seconds of black each time it
happens. **Live TV player per playlist** right below applies a different choice to one provider.

> **A channel that won't play is worked through every combination** — up to four: each engine on each
> stream format, each tried once. Then it stops and tells you, rather than spinning for ever.
> **Settings → Video player → Give up on a channel after** sets how long that may take (30 s default).

### ⏳ "Too many connections"
The spinner stays up with a live countdown and OwnTV retries by itself. Don't press Retry — just
wait.

### 🔒 Protected (DRM) channels
Widevine and ClearKey channels play with nothing to set up — your TV does the unlocking. They always
use ExoPlayer, so the engine toggle is hidden for them. Some cheaper boxes only allow standard
definition; that is the device's decision, not OwnTV's.

---

## 🗓️ TV Guide

### 📖 Open the guide
**Where:** sidebar → **Guide**
Opens scrolled to now, with an amber **NOW** marker about a third of the way across so the current
programme has context on its left. **Jump to Now** (top-right) returns after browsing.

### ➕ Add guide data
**Where:** Settings → EPG Sources
The guide is opt-in. After importing a playlist you are offered a one-tap sync.

### 🎯 Match channels to the guide
**Where:** Guide → **Auto-match EPG**, or long-press a channel → **Match EPG**
Auto-match does the bulk; the manual picker lists the most similar guide channels first.

### 🕰️ Guide time offset
**Where:** Settings → EPG → **Guide time offset** (global) · long-press a channel (just that one)
For a provider publishing its guide in another time zone. A re-sync never undoes it.

### 📋 Other guide touches
- **Sort** — A–Z · Provider · Live TV order · Catch-up first.
- **Cursor preview strip** — the programme under the cursor, without opening it.
- **Channel logos**, and a genre colour dot per channel.
- **↻ badge** — this programme can be replayed from the archive.
- **Long-press a channel label** to favourite it.
- **Settings → Layout → Guide Column Widths** — 10–90% split, must total 100%.

---

## ⏪ Catch-up & recording

### ▶️ Replay a past programme
**Where:** Guide → a past programme → **Watch from start**
Or long-press a channel → **Catch-up** and pick from the list. Up to 7 days, limited by what your
provider actually keeps.

### 🕐 Go back to a time
**Where:** full-screen player → **Go back to…**
Offers times counted back from now — `21:30`, `19:00`, `Sun 20:00`. The last row opens a
day/hour/minute picker. **This works even on channels with no guide at all.**

### ⏭️ Catch-up plays on
A finished catch-up programme continues to the next one, and hands over to the live channel once you
catch up with the present. Controlled by **Settings → Video player → Auto-play next episode**.

### 🕰️ Two clocks
While replaying, the player shows **Programme time** (when it originally aired) next to **Current
time**, with a **Playing / Then** guide row.

### ⏺️ Record live TV
**Where:** long-press a programme in the **Guide**, or a channel in the **list**, or the **Record**
button in the player
A guide recording follows the programme's times; the others record from now. **Record every showing**
sets a standing rule for that programme on that channel. Recordings appear in
**Downloads → Live TV**.

> A recording costs one of your provider's connections and says so before it starts.

---

## 🔲 Multiview — up to four channels

**Where:** the **Multiview** button in the player, or long-press channels → **Add to Multiview**
The channel on screen becomes the first tile. **One tile carries the sound**, marked with a speaker;
tap another to move it. **Sound only** gives up a tile's picture and keeps its commentary.
**Back stops everything** — nothing is left playing behind it.

A tile that cannot start says why rather than sitting blank.

### 🔌 How many channels your provider allows
**Where:** Settings → Playlists → **Info**
OwnTV measures this once, at a playlist's first sync, and warns before refusing a stream. **Re-test**
is inside Info — it stops anything playing and takes a few minutes.

---

## 🎬 Movies & Series

### 🖼️ Grid or list
**Where:** the top-right button
Swaps the poster wall for a compact list. Inside a show, the same button swaps episode rows for
episode pictures.

### ▶️ Resume
Partly-watched titles offer **Resume**. **Settings → Resume** chooses **Ask**, **Auto** or **Never**.
A series **opens on your last-watched episode**.

### ⏭️ Auto-play next episode
**Where:** Settings → Video player → **Auto-play next episode**
Rolls into the next season too. In the last 30 seconds a card counts down, with **Play now** and
**Cancel**.

### ✅ Watched state
A ✓ once watched to 95%, a progress bar when part-way. Season chips show `8/18`. Long-press →
**Mark as watched / unwatched** to correct it by hand.

### ↕️ Sort & hide
**Sorting** (per show, per profile) flips seasons and episodes oldest/newest first. **Hide watched**
filters the episode list.

### 📥 Download or play elsewhere
**Where:** long-press a title
**Download** queues it immediately; **Play in external player** opens VLC, MX Player and so on, just
this once.

### 🔧 Which engine plays films
**Where:** Settings → Video player → **Movies & Series player**
Same four choices as Live TV, defaulting to **mpv, then ExoPlayer**. Note **ExoPlayer only cannot
play DTS or TrueHD** — those need mpv. The **⇄** pill in the player flips the current film and
remembers it.

---

## 🎬 TMDB metadata

### 🖼️ Posters, plots, cast, trailers
**Where:** Settings → **Metadata (TMDB)**
**Metadata source** picks *Provider only*, *Provider + TMDB* or *TMDB only*. **Language** sets the
language of plots and artwork — separate from the app's own language.

### 📊 Your daily share
The built-in service is shared by everyone using OwnTV, so it has minute/hour/day allowances shown at
the top of the page.

### 🔑 Use your own key instead — recommended
**Where:** Settings → Metadata → **Get advanced TMDB info via remote**
A free personal TMDB key removes the shared limit. It's 32 characters, so send it from your phone by
QR + PIN rather than typing it. A self-hosted Cloudflare Worker also works (one is in the repo).

### 🔎 Fix a wrong match
**Where:** long-press a film or show
**Set TMDB name** corrects the title used for lookups; **Refetch TMDB details** forces a fresh fetch;
**Hide** removes it everywhere; **Play Trailer** appears when TMDB has one.

---

## 🏠 Home

### 🔥 Now Trending
**Where:** the first Home row · Settings → Home screen → **Now Trending**
Current TMDB charts, filtered to titles your provider can actually play. Up to 10, refreshed every
five to eight days. Needs TMDB metadata turned on.

### ▶️ Continue Watching
Partly-watched films, episodes and recent channels, newest first. Hold focus on a card for 3 seconds
and it expands into a preview — switch that off with **Play video in the hero row**.

### ⏭️ The Continue chip
**Where:** the top bar, every screen
One press resumes the most recent thing — a film, the next episode, or your last channel.

### 🧩 Rearrange Home
**Where:** Settings → **Home screen** (per profile)
Reorder or hide rows, filter the hero, and switch channel rows between **Cards** and **On Now** (an
inline mini-guide).

### 🧭 Trim the sidebar
**Where:** Settings → **Sidebar Menu Customization**
**Dynamic** adapts the menu to what the active playlist actually contains; **Static** lets you toggle
each icon yourself.

---

## 🔎 Search · 🕐 History · 📥 Downloads

### 🔎 Search
**Where:** sidebar → Search
Searches Live, Movies and Series together. With the box empty it shows a **Jump to** row. The first
**Back** clears the query; a second leaves.

### 🕐 History
**Where:** ⋯ More → History
Long-press → **Remove from History** for one item, or **Clear** for all, by type.

### 📥 Downloads
**Where:** sidebar → Downloads
Grouped Active · Waiting · Completed · Failed, with a storage bar. Long-press for **Pause · Resume ·
Retry · Delete**. Downloads keep running when you leave the app.
> Removing the USB stick mid-download marks that download failed — reconnect it and retry.

---

## 👥 Profiles

**Where:** Settings → **Profiles**
Each profile has its own favourites, history, resume points and layout. Add a **PIN lock**, or turn on
**Kids mode** to hide adult folders, items and TMDB results everywhere.

### 🚀 Where a profile opens
**Where:** Settings → App → **App startup**
**Home**, **Last channel**, **Live Favorites**, or one chosen channel picked from a searchable list.

---

## 🎛️ The player

| Control | Where |
|---|---|
| Clock (and programme time on a replay) | top centre, always |
| Engine pill **⇄ MPV/EXO** | control bar |
| **Go back to…** | control bar, catch-up channels |
| ⓘ **Stream info** | right-most button |
| **Record** | control bar, live channels, once enabled |
| **Multiview** | control bar, once enabled |
| Exit | **Back** — there is no exit button |

- **Remote transport keys** work — play/pause, next, previous, from the remote, a headset or a voice
  assistant.
- **A notification won't pause your film** — the sound dips and comes back.
- **Mini-player** — subtitles show in it too. Get back to it from any screen via **Now Playing**.

### 🎧 Audio Mode — listen with the screen free
**Where:** the **headphones** button on the player controls
Drops the picture, keeps the sound, and leaves a slim bar you can navigate with the D-pad.
**Fullscreen** returns; **✕** stops. *(An item that has no picture at all — a radio channel — says so
by itself.)*

---

## 💬 Subtitles & audio

### 🔎 Search OpenSubtitles
**Where:** player → Subtitles → **Search OpenSubtitles**
Needs a free [opensubtitles.com](https://www.opensubtitles.com) account. Sign in at
**Settings → OpenSubtitles** — by remote (QR + PIN) or by typing.

### 📁 Use a file you already have
**Where:** player → Subtitles → **Select local subtitle file**
No account, no internet. Browses USB and internal storage.

### ⏱️ Fix subtitle timing
**Where:** player → ADJUST → **Subtitle timing**
Nudge earlier or later in 0.1 s and 0.5 s steps.

### 🗣️ Preferred languages
**Where:** Settings → Video player → **Preferred audio / subtitle language**
Picks the right track automatically when a stream carries several.

### 🎚️ A/V sync
**Where:** player → Audio → **A/V sync**
Nudge until lips match, then **Remember this delay** to keep it for that item.

### 🔊 Surround sound
**Where:** Settings → Video player → **Surround sound**
**Auto** (recommended — tries surround, falls back to stereo if your TV can't) · **Stereo only** (the
right answer for TV speakers) · **Surround** (send Dolby/DTS to a real receiver).

---

## 🎨 Make it yours

### 🎨 Theme & accent
**Where:** Settings → Appearance
Dark, AMOLED or Light, plus an accent colour with presets and a full picker. The accent reaches the
player too — seek bar, active buttons, badges.

### 🔦 Focus highlight
**Where:** Settings → **Focus highlight**
The colour and thickness of the ring around whatever is selected. Applies everywhere.

### 🪟 Glass Effect
**Where:** Settings → **Glass Effect**
A frosted look with a live preview and six presets from **Ultra Clear** to **Opaque**. Choose which
surfaces get it, and set your own background image (local file or URL).
> Real frost needs a background image and **Android 12+**. Without those, panels are simply tinted.

### 🔤 Font & size
**Where:** Settings → Appearance → **Font customization**
Main text 60–140%, popup text and popup boxes independently, and a choice of bundled fonts.
> Below **85% zoom** OwnTV warns first — very small sizes draw many more items and can exhaust a
> low-memory TV.

### 📐 Panel widths
**Where:** Settings → **Panel Width Adjustment**
How wide the category rail, list and preview pane are, per section. The third panel can be **0%** to
hide it entirely. Each section must total 100%.

### 🗂️ Categories & items
**Where:** long-press a category → **Customize**, or Settings → **Customize Categories & Items**
Hide, rename, reorder, and **unhide**. Highlights:
- **Bulk rename** — add or strip a prefix/suffix across a whole category, with **Auto cleanup** for
  country, quality and codec tags, a review step, and **Restore original names** as the undo.
- **Custom combined categories** — **＋ New category**, then **Move to category…** from any item.
- **Span select** — long-press a **Hide** or **move** button to act on a whole block at once.
- **PIN lock** this screen with **Set PIN**.

### 🔀 Reorder the long-press menus
**Where:** Settings → Layout → **Long-press menus**
Put the actions you use most at the top.

### 🎞️ Animations
**Where:** Settings → **Animations**
Turn interface motion off for a snappier feel on a slower box.

## ⚙️ Settings worth knowing

Settings is two columns — sections on the left, their settings on the right. **Quick** at the top
holds the six most-used switches, and the **search pill** searches every setting at once.

| Setting | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Live latency** | Video player → Live TV | How close to the live edge to play. Lower = less delay, more stutter risk |
| **Pre-buffer live streams** | Video player → Live TV | Collect a few seconds first on a flaky provider |
| **Give up on a channel after** | Video player → Live TV | 30 s default — bounds how long a dead channel can spin |
| **Hardware decoder** | Video player | On for smooth 4K; off only to diagnose |
| **HDR** | Video player | Use HDR output when the video and TV support it |
| **Auto frame rate** | Video player | Match the TV's refresh rate to the content. Off by default |
| **Deinterlacing** | Video player | Smooths comb lines on some SD channels. Off by default |
| **Seek step / Live rewind step** | Video player | How far the skip buttons jump |
| **Default volume** | Video player | 0–150%, where everything starts |
| **Reset saved player choices / zoom / volume** | Video player | Forget everything the player remembered per item |
| **Custom DNS** | Network → DNS | System, Google, Cloudflare, Quad9, or DNS-over-HTTPS |
| **External player** | Video player | Separate switches for Live TV, Movies and Series |
| **Weather** | Appearance → Weather | The top-bar chip, with a custom location and °C/°F |
| **Check updates on startup** | App | Be told when a newer version is on GitHub |
| **Error log** | App, last row | The last crash and recent playback failures — exportable |
| **Detailed playback logging** | Video player → Diagnostics | Turn on before reproducing a playback bug |

### 💾 Backup & Restore
**Where:** ⋯ More → **Backup & Restore**
One `.own` file with your profiles, sources, every setting, your background image and downloaded
subtitles — **optionally encrypted with your own password**. Restore locally or over Wi-Fi.
> Android's own automatic backup is deliberately disabled, so app data only ever leaves the device
> through this screen. Passwords ride along **only** if you set a backup password.

### 🔄 Local sync with your phone
**Where:** ⋯ More → **Local sync**
Swap favourites, history and resume points with the OwnTV mobile app over your own Wi-Fi — no
account, no cloud. **Both devices must open the Local sync screen**; you see exactly what will change
before it changes.

## 🛠️ Build your own M3U playlist

OwnTV sorts each entry by its tags:

```
tagged series  →  Series tab
tagged vod/movie  →  Movies grid
no VOD tag  →  Live TV
```

### One line, explained

```m3u
#EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="bbc1.uk" tvg-logo="http://…/bbc1.png" group-title="UK" ,BBC One
http://your-provider/live/user/pass/1234.ts
```

- **`group-title`** — the category inside the tab.
- **`tvg-logo`** — the logo or poster (optional).
- **`tvg-id`** — the EPG id used to match guide data (Live TV).
- **after the comma** — the title shown in the app.

### Movies

```m3u
#EXTINF:-1 type="movie" group-title="Action" tvg-logo="…/poster.jpg" ,Mad Max
http://your-provider/movie/user/pass/555.mkv
```

### Series — the one that matters

```m3u
#EXTINF:-1 type="series" group-title="Drama" ,Breaking Bad S01E01 Pilot
#EXTINF:-1 type="series" group-title="Drama" ,Breaking Bad S01E02 Cat's in the Bag
```

The text **before** the marker becomes the show name; the text **after** it becomes the episode
title. Markers: `S01E05` (also `s1e5`, `S01 E05`, `S01.E05`, `S01-E05`) and `1x05`.

> **Keep the show name identical across its episodes** — that is what groups them into one show.
> A line with no marker is still added, as a plain sequential episode.

---

## 🩺 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Try this |
|---|---|
| A channel stutters or shows artifacts on 4K | The **⇄ MPV/EXO** pill — compatibility mode fixes most of these |
| One provider glitches, another is fine | Turn on **Prefer HLS** for that playlist, or set **Live TV player per playlist** |
| Channel won't open at all | It already tried all four combinations. Check **Error log** (Settings → App) |
| "Too many connections" | Wait — OwnTV counts down and retries by itself. Don't press Retry |
| Sound but a black picture | OwnTV switches engines by itself; if neither can, it says so |
| Stalker portal refuses the login | Re-check the MAC, and the TV's **date & time** |
| Guide is blank | **Settings → EPG** — add a feed and sync it, then run **Auto-match EPG** |
| Audio out of sync | Player → Audio → **A/V sync**, then **Remember this delay** |
| Update says there isn't enough space | In-app updates need room for the whole APK — free some and retry |

**Still stuck?** **Settings → App → Error log** holds the last crash and recent playback failures, and
exports to `Download/owntv-playback-report.txt`. Bring it to
[t.me/owntvplayer](https://t.me/owntvplayer).

## 💡 Tips

- **Long-press OK** is the answer to "where is that option?" nine times out of ten.
- **Left, then Left again** in full screen gets you from channel list to every category without
  stopping the stream.
- Set a **default playlist** if you mostly use one — everything narrows to it at once.
- Turn on **Run in background** during a big import and just start watching.
- A **free personal TMDB key** removes the shared metadata limit; send it from your phone by QR.
